*"Mílóng Sēnlín" (迷龙森林) - The Mystic Dragon Forest*  

Deep within the heart of **Mílóng Sēnlín**, the Mystic Dragon Forest, lies the fabled **Temple of Eternal Whispers**. Legends speak of an ancient sanctuary hidden among the dense trees, where the secrets of immortality and untold power are guarded by the forest's eternal protectors—dragons.  

The forest is alive, its paths twisting and turning into spirals that defy logic and reason. These spirals are no accident; they are the dragons' ancient magic, designed to disorient and confuse any who dare to enter. The spirals are said to represent the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth, a sacred pattern that mirrors the dragons' own mystical nature.  

As an adventurer, your quest is to uncover the entrance to the **Temple of Eternal Whispers**, but the journey will not be easy. The dragons will test your resolve, leading you deeper into the labyrinthine spirals of the forest. Each clearing you find may hold a clue—or a trap. The spirals are not just paths; they are trials, meant to separate the worthy from the unworthy.  

Will you navigate the enchanted spirals, outwit the dragons, and uncover the temple's secrets? Or will you become another lost soul, forever wandering the mystical paths of **Mílóng Sēnlín**?
